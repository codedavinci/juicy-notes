The rule is very simple, I write a code example and then "idiotically" I'll say **what** it is, **when** to apply it, and **why** this way because honestly, I can't rely on my brain, can you ?

## Arrow Functions

```js
//ES5
var sendMessage = function (message, sender) {
    return message + sender;
}
//ES6
var sendMessage = (message, sender) =>  {
    return message + sender; 
}
//ES6 Short-Hand (More than one parameter)
var rectangle = (length, width) => length * width;

//ES6 Short-Hand (One parament)
var square = x => x * x; 

//Handling Actions Inside an Object
//ES5 
var sendMessage = {
  name: "Eddie",
  handleMessage: function(message, handlerCb){
    handlerCb(message);
  }, 
  sayIt: function () {
    var that = this; // Make a copy of the whole scope, so we can access "name" inside of the callback function.
    this.handleMessage("Good morning ", function (message){
        that.name;
        console.log(message + that.name);
    }) 
  }
}


var sendMessage ={
  name: "John",
  
  handleMessage: function (message, handler){
    handler(message);
  },
  
  sayIt: function () {
    this.handleMessage("Hello, ", message => console.log(message +       this.name)) // The arrow functions leave an open door, to access the scope using "this".
  }
}

```
**What it is:** This is a new feature called "Arrow Functions" from the new update on *ECMAScript2015* or *ES6* Version. 

**When to apply it:** There's no specification saying when to apply it, but it's always good to keep the code consistent, by following the main web standards such as: If you have a function with more than one parameter and have error, data and a callback, please always folow the order `someFunction(err,  data, callback)`. 

**Why:** Because all *Web Developers* will love you forever for not making their life harder ðŸ˜¬  


## Let Keyword
#### Set variables

```js
//Case where you Reasign a variable
var animal = "panda";
{ var animal = "koala"; }
console.log(animal); //koala
//The majority people think that it would display "panda" because it's out of the curly braces ðŸ˜œ, but in this case because the variable has the same name, it's simply reassigning its value. 

//Solution for it (using "let")
let animal = "panda";
{ let animal = "koala"; }
console.log(animal); //panda

//Solution #2 using "var" (locking it in a function)
var animal = "panda"
function setAnimal(){
    var animal = "koala"; //blocked by the scope
}
console.log(animal) //panda
```

#### Loops

```js
//ES5 - Example
var array = []
for(var index; index < 10; index++){
    array.push(function(){
        console.log(index);
    });
}
array.forEach(function(f){
    f();
});


//ES6
var array = [];
for(var index = 0; index < 10; index++ ){
    array.push(() => console.log(index));
}
array.forEach((f) => f()); // 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.  Because the last time the loop iterate, the ten (10) copies of the variable index is reassigned with the last value, because it's declared with "var" 

//Solution Using let
var array = [];
for(let index = 0; index < 10; index++ ){
    //Each time it iterates, a new copy of index (with a new  reference) is created with the keyword "let", rather than just create a copies of the same reference with "var" 
    array.push(() => console.log(index));
}
array.forEach((f) => f());

```

**What it is:** This is a new keyword called `let`,  from the new update on *ECMAScript2015* or *ES6* Version. The `let` allows us to use block scopping

**When to apply it:** Whenever you come up with a situation where you need to assign a variable with the same and doesn't want it to be affected by changing it's reference, for instance in loops.

**Why:** Because if you don't you'll just over-perform the system with your code, overthink on your logic and face lots of problems such as reassignments ðŸ™… ðŸ™…

## Parameters

#### Default Arguments
```js
//No Arguments
function sayIt(message, name){
    console.log(message + ", " + name);
} 
sayIt(); //undefined, undefined

//Defining default Arguments
function sayIt(message, name ="Eddie"){
    console.log(message + ", " + name);
} 
sayIt("Good morning"); // Good morning, Eddie

//Overwriting Default Arguments
function sayIt(message, name="Eddie"){
    console.log(message + ", " + name);
} 
sayIt("Good morning", "Panda"); // Good morning, Panda

//Function as an argument (No default)
function apply(done){
    done();
}
apply(); //Error - undefined is not a function.

//Function as an argument (No default - ES5)
function apply(done){
    done();
}
apply(function(){
    console.log("done!");
}); //done !

//Function as an argument with default param (ES5)
function apply(done = function(){
    console.log("done!");
}){
    done();
}
apply(); //done!

//ES6
function apply(done = () => console.log("done!")){
    done();
}
apply(); //done!

//ES6 Short-hand using let
let apply = (done = () = console.log("done!")) => done(); //done!
```


**What it is:** Very cool feature that allows us set *default arguments in our functions*

**When to apply it:** Whenever you come up with a situation where you need to assign with a default value. 

**Why:** Sometimes, there are cases that we want to return something to the client, even though it has receveid nothing ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž


## Const Declarations

```js
//ES5 Standards for constants
var PI = 3.14; //All in uppercase to represent that it's a constant.
var PORT = 8080;// but still, it could easily be reassigned. 
PORT = 3000;
console.log(PORT); //3000


//ES6 new feature "const"
const PI = 3.14;
const PORT = 8080;
PORT = 3000;
console.log(PORT); //Error:  the variable PORT is read-only and can't be reassigned.

//ES6 assign properties to a const variable.
const OBJ = {};
OBJ.name = "Eddie";
OBJ.age = 26;
console.log(OBJ); //{ name: "Eddie",  age: 26 }

//ES6 Reassign a const variable. 
const OBJ = {};
OBJ = "Eddie";
console.log(OBJ); //Error, OBJ is read-only and can't be reassigned.
//
```

**What it is:** the keyword `const` allows us to create a constant of a variable reference, this is very importa: **just of a variable reference**, It means that you can change its reference, for instance, if you we assign a variable with a string, I can't change this string, but if I assign a variable with an empty object, I can add properties to it ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜±. Cool, right ??

**When to apply it:** Whenever you need to create a variable that must not be changed its reference, such as PORT's, Static values, Server IP and etc.. 

**Why:** Because as said earlier, we want to proctect our variables against being overwritten /changed ðŸ’ª ðŸ’ª

## Short-Hand Properties
```js
let firstName = "Eddie";
let lastName = "Henrique";
let person = {firstName, lastName}
console.log(person) // {firstName: "Eddie",  lastName: "Henrique"}
let department = "IT";
let employee = {person, deparment}   //{ department: "IT", person:{ firstName: "Eddie", lastName: "Henrique" } }
```

**What it is:** We can easily construct objects and its properties with this new sintaxe.

**When to apply it:** Whenever we face some requirements where need to create new properties into our new object. This way we don't have the necessary of creating multiples models. 

**Why:** Because we need to be cautious when to extend our objects, use with moderation. ðŸ‘€ 

## Object Enhancement

```js
let gender = "male";
let legs = 4;
function walk(){ 
console.log("Walking..");
}

let healthAnimal = {gender, legs, walk} //because the properties are the same name, the object treats as if it was  {color: color, doors: doors}(ES5 way !)
console.log(house.color);
console.log(house.doors);
healthAnimal.walk(); // "male", 4, "Walking.."


//Different ways of constructing Objects.
let healthAnimal = { gender, 
                    legs, 
                    walk(){   //In ES5 would be  walk: function() { }
                    console.log("Walking..");
                    } 
console.log(house.color);
console.log(house.doors);
healthAnimal.walk(); // "male", 4, "Walking.."

//Another way, through computed properties ["property"]

let healthAnimal = { gender, 
                    legs, 
                     ["walk"]: function {
                    console.log("Walking..");
                    } 
console.log(house.color);
console.log(house.doors);
healthAnimal.walk(); // "male", 4, "Walking.."

```

**What it is:** That's the new and beautiful several ways of construct an object in the new ECMAScript2015(ES6)

**When to apply it:** It'll depend on your requirements. One thing we know, it facilitates very much on how to design our application with ES6 .

**Why:** Because It's just awesome ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚

## Spread Operators
```js

//Merging two arrays without Spread Operators
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let array2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
array.push(array2);
console.log(array); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]

//Console log With Spread Operators 
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let array2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
array.push(...array2); //Adding the Spread sign "..."
console.log(array); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] (It merges without any problem)
console.log(...array); // 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (Just the values of the array)

//Spread into parameters 

let measuraments = [4, 2, 5];
function getVolumeRetangularPrism(length, width, height){
    let result =  length * width * height
    console.log(result);
}
getVolumeRetangularPrism(...measuraments); //40 

```

**What it is:** Spread Operators allow us to easily manipulate the values of an Array, by freeing it. 

**When to apply it:** Whenever you need to use the data of an array you can easily free it, by using the 3 dots, for instance, merging 2 arrays with spread operators is very easy !

**Why:** I wouldn't want to complicate this process  ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚
